Brief description of the project

•	The game is at the stage of concept development,
There is a necessary team - graphic designers, and web developers.
Specialists in creating games based on Unity.
A team of historians who will make the game authentic to the time of the existence of historical events and wars.

The basic concept of the game.
To enter the game, you need to place a bet. Each side puts 100 points on the line.
The game is based on a card basis, where each side is given 5 cards (with different denominations), but which can make up the necessary combination when interacting with each other,
opponents must open 3 cards each, the player who scores the required number of points wins.
The reward is divided, the winner receives 68% of the bet, the loser receives 29% of the bet, 3% is the platform commission.
The ability to play teams with each other, 2x2, 3x3.
